# Learning in Public 🚀

This repository represents my **long-term, continuous learning journey across Data Analysis, Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Artificial Intelligence**, along with supporting analytics and business intelligence skills.

It is a living workspace where I document my progress, practice concepts hands-on, work with real-world datasets, and gradually build strong foundations across the full **data & AI ecosystem**.

This repository focuses on **learning, consistency, and growth**, not only final or polished projects.

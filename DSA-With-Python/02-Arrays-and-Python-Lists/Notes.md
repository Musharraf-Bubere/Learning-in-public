# Arrays and Python Lists

## Day 5 — Introduction to Arrays and Python Lists

### 1. What is an Array?

An array is a data structure that stores multiple elements in an ordered collection.

Elements are associated with positions called indexes.

Example:

```text
Index:    0    1    2    3    4
          ↓    ↓    ↓    ↓    ↓
Values:  10   20   30   40   50
```

Indexes usually start from `0`.

---

## 2. Python Lists

Python provides a built-in `list` type that is commonly used for array-like data.

Example:

```python
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
```

For our DSA practice, Python lists will be used extensively to implement and understand array-based algorithms.

Important distinction:

> An array is a data structure concept, while Python's `list` is a built-in data type with dynamic behavior and array-like indexing.

---

# 3. Accessing an Element

Elements can be accessed directly using their index.

```python
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

print(numbers[3])
```

Output:

```text
40
```

Because the index is directly used:

```text
numbers[3]
```

the operation is:

```text
Time Complexity: O(1)
```

### Key Idea

> Accessing an element by index is constant time.

---

# 4. Traversal

Traversal means visiting every element in the list.

Example:

```python
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

for number in numbers:
    print(number)
```

Every element is processed.

If:

```text
n = 5
```

there are 5 iterations.

If:

```text
n = 1000
```

there are approximately 1000 iterations.

Therefore:

```text
Time Complexity: O(n)
```

### Key Idea

> Traversal processes elements proportionally to the input size.

---

# 5. Linear Search

Linear Search checks elements one by one until the target is found.

Example:

```python
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

target = 40

for number in numbers:
    if number == target:
        print("Found:", target)
        break
```

The search progresses like:

```text
10 → 20 → 30 → 40
              ↑
            found
```

### Worst Case

If the target is at the end:

```text
10 → 20 → 30 → 40 → 50
```

all elements are checked.

If the target doesn't exist, all elements are also checked.

Therefore:

```text
Linear Search
Best Case  → O(1)
Worst Case → O(n)
```

When we generally describe Linear Search complexity, we use:

```text
O(n)
```

because we usually focus on the worst case.

---

# 6. Linear Search Using a Function

A reusable implementation:

```python
def linear_search(numbers, target):
    for number in numbers:
        if number == target:
            return True
    return False
```

Usage:

```python
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

print(linear_search(numbers, 40))
print(linear_search(numbers, 100))
```

Output:

```text
True
False
```

The worst-case complexity remains:

```text
O(n)
```

---

# 7. Python For-Else with Linear Search

Python's `for` loop can have an `else` block.

Example:

```python
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

target = 100

for number in numbers:
    if number == target:
        print("Found:", target)
        break
else:
    print("Not found")
```

The `else` block executes when the loop finishes without encountering `break`.

Therefore:

```text
Target found
→ break
→ for-else skipped

Target not found
→ loop finishes
→ else executes
```

---

# 8. Insertion

Insertion means adding an element to a specific position.

Example:

```python
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

numbers.insert(2, 25)
```

Result:

```text
[10, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50]
```

To make room for `25`, elements after the insertion position may need to shift:

```text
30 → right
40 → right
50 → right
```

Therefore, insertion at the beginning or middle is generally:

```text
O(n)
```

---

# 9. Append

Appending means adding an element to the end of a Python list.

Example:

```python
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

numbers.append(60)
```

Result:

```text
[10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]
```

Appending to the end of a Python list is:

```text
O(1) amortized
```

### What does amortized mean?

Most individual appends are constant time, although occasionally Python may need to resize its underlying storage.

When averaged across many append operations:

```text
append → O(1) amortized
```

For now, remember the complexity rather than worrying about the internal memory implementation.

---

# 10. Deletion

An element can be removed using `pop()`.

Example:

```python
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

numbers.pop(2)
```

Result:

```text
[10, 20, 40, 50]
```

When an element is removed from the beginning or middle, elements after it may need to shift left.

Therefore:

```text
Delete from beginning/middle → O(n)
```

---

# 11. Removing the Last Element

Removing the last element is different.

```python
numbers.pop()
```

The last element can be removed without shifting the remaining elements.

Therefore:

```text
pop() from end → O(1)
```

---

# 12. Array/List Operation Complexity

| Operation | Complexity |
|---|---:|
| Access by index | O(1) |
| Traversal | O(n) |
| Linear Search — Best Case | O(1) |
| Linear Search — Worst Case | O(n) |
| Insert at beginning/middle | O(n) |
| Append at end | O(1) amortized |
| Delete at beginning/middle | O(n) |
| `pop()` from end | O(1) |

---

# 13. Important Mental Model

Think about what the operation needs to do.

### Direct access

```text
Give me index 3
↓
Directly access it
↓
O(1)
```

### Traversal

```text
Visit every element
↓
O(n)
```

### Linear Search

```text
Check elements one by one
↓
O(n) worst case
```

### Insertion in the middle

```text
Make space
↓
Shift elements
↓
O(n)
```

### Deletion in the middle

```text
Remove element
↓
Shift remaining elements
↓
O(n)
```

### Append

```text
Add to end
↓
O(1) amortized
```

---

---

# 15. Big O Connection

Our previous Big O knowledge now connects directly to arrays:

```text
Array Access
→ O(1)

Array Traversal
→ O(n)

Linear Search
→ O(n)

Insertion
→ O(n)

Deletion
→ O(n)
```

This is the beginning of understanding **why different data structures are useful for different operations**.

---

## Day 6 — Array Traversal Patterns

Today we practiced common array traversal problems using Python lists.

The main idea is:

> Traverse the list once and maintain a running value.

These patterns are extremely common in DSA.

---

# 16. Finding the Maximum Element

To find the largest element, start by assuming the first element is the maximum.

Then traverse the list and update the maximum whenever a larger element is found.

Example:

    numbers = [4, 7, 2, 9, 5]

    maximum = numbers[0]

    for number in numbers:
        if number > maximum:
            maximum = number

    print(maximum)

Output:

    9

The algorithm checks each element and keeps track of the largest value seen so far.

### Complexity

    Time Complexity: O(n)

    Space Complexity: O(1)

Why?

There are n elements, so we may need to examine every element.

Only one additional variable, maximum, is used.

---

# 17. Finding the Minimum Element

Finding the minimum uses the same pattern as finding the maximum.

The difference is that we check whether the current element is smaller.

Example:

    numbers = [10, 5, 2, 8, 3]

    minimum = numbers[0]

    for number in numbers:
        if number < minimum:
            minimum = number

    print(minimum)

Output:

    2

### Reusable Function

    def find_minimum(numbers):
        minimum = numbers[0]

        for number in numbers:
            if number < minimum:
                minimum = number

        return minimum

### Complexity

    Time Complexity: O(n)

    Space Complexity: O(1)

---

# 18. Calculating the Sum

To calculate the sum of all elements, maintain a running total.

Start the total at 0.

Example:

    numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40]

    sum_numbers = 0

    for number in numbers:
        sum_numbers = sum_numbers + number

    print(sum_numbers)

Output:

    100

### Reusable Function

    def calculate_sum(numbers):
        sum_numbers = 0

        for number in numbers:
            sum_numbers = sum_numbers + number

        return sum_numbers

### Complexity

    Time Complexity: O(n)

    Space Complexity: O(1)

Why?

Every element must be visited once.

Only one additional variable is used to store the running total.

---

# 19. Counting Occurrences

Counting occurrences means finding how many times a target value appears in a list.

Example:

    numbers = [10, 20, 30, 30, 40, 30]

    target = 30

    repeat_number = 0

    for number in numbers:
        if number == target:
            repeat_number += 1

    print(repeat_number)

Output:

    3

### Reusable Function

    def count_occurrences(numbers, target):
        repeat_number = 0

        for number in numbers:
            if number == target:
                repeat_number += 1

        return repeat_number

### Complexity

    Time Complexity: O(n)

    Space Complexity: O(1)

Why?

The algorithm may need to check every element, even if the target is found multiple times.

The comparison itself is O(1), but it is performed n times.

Therefore:

    O(1) × n = O(n)

---

# 20. The Running Value Pattern

The problems we solved today follow a common pattern.

The general structure is:

    running_value = initial_value

    for element in numbers:
        # update running_value

    return running_value

Different problems use different running values.

| Problem | Running Value | Update Rule |
|---|---|---|
| Find Maximum | `maximum` | Update if current element is larger |
| Find Minimum | `minimum` | Update if current element is smaller |
| Calculate Sum | `sum_numbers` | Add current element |
| Count Occurrences | `repeat_number` | Increase when target is found |

This pattern is one of the most important basic array traversal techniques.

---

# 21. Why These Algorithms Are O(n)

Consider:

    for number in numbers:
        if number == target:
            repeat_number += 1

The comparison:

    number == target

takes constant time:

    O(1)

However, the loop may execute once for every element.

If the list contains n elements:

    O(1) × n = O(n)

Therefore:

    Overall Time Complexity = O(n)

### Important Rule

> A single traversal through n elements is generally O(n).

---

# 22. Maximum and Minimum Pattern

Maximum and minimum problems are almost identical.

### Maximum

    maximum = numbers[0]

    for number in numbers:
        if number > maximum:
            maximum = number

### Minimum

    minimum = numbers[0]

    for number in numbers:
        if number < minimum:
            minimum = number

The main difference is the comparison operator:

    Maximum → >

    Minimum → <

---

# 23. Running Counter Pattern

Counting problems commonly use a counter.

Example:

    count = 0

    for number in numbers:
        if condition:
            count += 1

    return count

This pattern can be used for:

- Counting occurrences
- Counting positive numbers
- Counting negative numbers
- Counting even numbers
- Counting elements satisfying a condition

The traversal is usually:

    Time Complexity: O(n)

And if only a counter is used:

    Space Complexity: O(1)

---

# 24. Running Sum Pattern

The running sum pattern maintains a total while traversing.

Example:

    total = 0

    for number in numbers:
        total += number

    return total

The important idea is:

> Do not repeatedly calculate the entire sum. Build the result while traversing.

Complexity:

    Time Complexity: O(n)

    Space Complexity: O(1)

---

# 25. Important Mental Model

When given an array problem, ask:

    1. Do I need to visit every element?

    2. What information do I need to maintain while traversing?

    3. What should the initial value be?

    4. How should I update that value?

    5. What should I return after the loop?

For example:

    Find maximum
    → maintain maximum

    Find minimum
    → maintain minimum

    Find sum
    → maintain total

    Count elements
    → maintain counter

---

# 26. Day 6 Key Takeaways

- Array traversal means visiting elements one by one.

- A single complete traversal is generally O(n).

- Finding the maximum can be solved using a running maximum.

- Finding the minimum can be solved using a running minimum.

- Sum problems can be solved using a running total.

- Counting problems can be solved using a running counter.

- These algorithms usually require O(1) extra space when only a few variables are used.

- An O(1) operation inside an O(n) loop results in O(n) overall time.

- Maximum and minimum use almost identical logic.

- The running value pattern is a fundamental DSA technique.

---

# 27. Connection With Previous Big O Knowledge

Our Big O concepts now directly apply to array problems.

    Direct index access
    → O(1)

    Single traversal
    → O(n)

    Linear search
    → O(n) worst case

    Find maximum
    → O(n)

    Find minimum
    → O(n)

    Calculate sum
    → O(n)

    Count occurrences
    → O(n)

The key skill is no longer just memorizing Big O.

We are now learning to:

    Look at the code
    ↓
    Understand how many times operations execute
    ↓
    Determine the complexity

This is the foundation for analyzing more advanced DSA algorithms.

## Day 7 — Reverse an Array Using Two Pointers

### 1. Problem

Given an array/list, reverse the order of its elements.

Example:

`[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]`

After reversing:

`[50, 40, 30, 20, 10]`

---

### 2. Two-Pointer Technique

The two-pointer technique uses two indexes to work from both ends of the array.

- `left` starts from the beginning.
- `right` starts from the end.
- Swap the elements at `left` and `right`.
- Move `left` forward.
- Move `right` backward.
- Continue until the pointers meet or cross.

Initial positions:

`left = 0`

`right = len(numbers) - 1`

---

### 3. Swapping Elements

Python allows two elements to be swapped in one statement:

`numbers[left], numbers[right] = numbers[right], numbers[left]`

For example:

`[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]`

Swap index `0` and index `4`:

`[50, 20, 30, 40, 10]`

Then swap index `1` and index `3`:

`[50, 40, 30, 20, 10]`

---

### 4. Moving the Pointers

After every swap:

`left += 1`

`right -= 1`

This moves both pointers toward the center.

Example:

`left = 0, right = 4`

After the first swap:

`left = 1, right = 3`

After the second swap:

`left = 2, right = 2`

---

### 5. Why `while left < right`?

The loop condition is:

`while left < right:`

We do not need to swap when `left == right`.

For an odd-sized array, both pointers meet at the middle element.

Example:

`[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]`

When:

`left = 2`

`right = 2`

The element `30` is already in its correct position.

For an even-sized array, the pointers eventually cross.

Therefore, `left < right` correctly handles both cases.

---

### 6. Complete Algorithm

1. Set `left = 0`.
2. Set `right = len(numbers) - 1`.
3. While `left < right`:
   - Swap `numbers[left]` and `numbers[right]`.
   - Increment `left`.
   - Decrement `right`.
4. Return the reversed array.

---

### 7. Implementation

`def reverse_array(numbers):
    left = 0
    right = len(numbers) - 1

    while left < right:
        numbers[left], numbers[right] = numbers[right], numbers[left]

        left += 1
        right -= 1

    return numbers`

Example:

`numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]`

`reverse_array(numbers)`

Output:

`[50, 40, 30, 20, 10]`

---

### 8. Trace

Array:

`[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]`

Initial:

`left = 0`
`right = 4`

First swap:

`10 ↔ 50`

Array:

`[50, 20, 30, 40, 10]`

Move pointers:

`left = 1`
`right = 3`

Second swap:

`20 ↔ 40`

Array:

`[50, 40, 30, 20, 10]`

Move pointers:

`left = 2`
`right = 2`

Condition:

`left < right`

`2 < 2` → False

Loop stops.

Final array:

`[50, 40, 30, 20, 10]`

---

### 9. Complexity Analysis

#### Time Complexity

There are approximately `n / 2` swaps.

Therefore:

`O(n / 2)`

Ignoring constants:

`O(n)`

Time Complexity = **O(n)**

#### Space Complexity

Only two variables are used:

- `left`
- `right`

No new array is created.

Space Complexity = **O(1)**

This is an **in-place** algorithm.

---

### 10. Important Concept — In-Place Algorithm

An in-place algorithm modifies the original array instead of creating another array.

For example:

`numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]`

The same `numbers` list is modified during the swaps.

This allows us to reverse the array using:

- O(n) time
- O(1) extra space

---

### 11. Mental Model

Think of two people standing at opposite ends of the array.

`left → [10, 20, 30, 40, 50] ← right`

They swap the elements.

Then both move one step toward the center.

`    left → [20, 30, 40] ← right`

They continue until they meet.

This is the basic idea behind the **two-pointer technique**.

---

### 12. Key Takeaways

- Two pointers can process an array from both ends.
- `left` starts at index `0`.
- `right` starts at index `len(numbers) - 1`.
- Swap the two elements.
- Move `left` forward and `right` backward.
- Use `while left < right`.
- Reversing this way takes O(n) time.
- It uses O(1) extra space.
- The algorithm modifies the original array in-place.
- Two-pointer techniques are useful for many array and string problems.

## Day 8 — Check if an Array is Sorted

### 1. Problem

Given an array/list, determine whether its elements are sorted in ascending order.

Example:

`[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]`

Result:

`True`

Example:

`[10, 20, 15, 40, 50]`

Result:

`False`

---

### 2. Core Idea

To check whether an array is sorted in ascending order, compare every element with the element immediately after it.

For ascending order:

`numbers[i] <= numbers[i + 1]`

If we ever find:

`numbers[i] > numbers[i + 1]`

the ascending order is broken.

Therefore, the array is not sorted.

---

### 3. Adjacent Element Comparison

For:

`[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]`

We compare:

`10 <= 20` → True

`20 <= 30` → True

`30 <= 40` → True

`40 <= 50` → True

All adjacent pairs are in the correct order.

Therefore:

`Sorted → True`

For:

`[10, 20, 15, 40, 50]`

We compare:

`10 <= 20` → True

`20 <= 15` → False

The order is broken.

Therefore:

`Not Sorted → False`

---

### 4. Index-Based Traversal

We use indexes because we need access to both:

`numbers[i]`

and:

`numbers[i + 1]`

The loop is:

`for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):`

The `-1` is important because `i + 1` must always be a valid index.

For an array of length `5`, the indexes checked are:

`0, 1, 2, 3`

The last comparison is:

`numbers[3]` with `numbers[4]`

---

### 5. Ascending Order Function

`def is_sorted(numbers):
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        if numbers[i] > numbers[i + 1]:
            return False

    return True`

If an invalid adjacent pair is found, the function immediately returns `False`.

If the loop completes without finding an invalid pair, the function returns `True`.

---

### 6. Descending Order

The same idea can be used to check descending order.

For descending order:

`50 >= 40 >= 30 >= 20 >= 10`

The order is broken when:

`numbers[i] < numbers[i + 1]`

Function:

`def is_sorted(numbers):
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        if numbers[i] < numbers[i + 1]:
            return False

    return True`

---

### 7. Early Return

An important optimization is returning immediately when the order is broken.

Example:

`[50, 60, 40, 30, 20]`

For descending order:

`50 < 60` → True

The function immediately executes:

`return False`

There is no need to check the remaining elements.

---

### 8. Best-Case Time Complexity

If the first comparison already shows that the array is not sorted, the function returns immediately.

Example:

`[50, 60, 40, 30, 20]`

Only one comparison is required.

Best-case time complexity:

`O(1)`

---

### 9. Worst-Case Time Complexity

If the array is sorted, the function must check all adjacent pairs.

For `n` elements, there are `n - 1` comparisons.

Therefore:

`O(n - 1)`

Ignoring constants and lower-order terms:

`O(n)`

Worst-case time complexity:

**O(n)**

---

### 10. Space Complexity

The algorithm does not create another array or data structure.

It only uses a loop variable `i` and a few constant-size variables.

The additional memory does not grow with `n`.

Therefore:

**Space Complexity = O(1)**

---

### 11. Sequential vs Nested Loops

When analyzing time complexity, the relationship between loops is important.

Sequential loops are added:

`O(n) + O(n) = O(2n) = O(n)`

Nested loops are multiplied:

`O(n) × O(n) = O(n²)`

Example of sequential loops:

`for i in range(n):
    print(i)

for j in range(n):
    print(j)`

Time complexity:

`O(n)`

Example of nested loops:

`for i in range(n):
    for j in range(n):
        print(i, j)`

Time complexity:

`O(n²)`

---

### 12. Complexity Analysis Checklist

When analyzing a new algorithm:

1. Identify the input size `n`.
2. Find the loops.
3. Determine how many times each loop can execute.
4. Check whether loops are sequential or nested.
5. Consider early returns or breaks.
6. Ignore constant factors.
7. Keep the dominant term.
8. For space complexity, check whether additional memory grows with `n`.

---

### 13. Edge Cases

Empty array:

`[]` → `True`

Single-element array:

`[5]` → `True`

Already sorted:

`[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]` → `True`

Not sorted:

`[10, 20, 15, 40, 50]` → `False`

---

### 14. Key Takeaways

- Check adjacent elements to determine whether an array is sorted.
- Use `numbers[i]` and `numbers[i + 1]`.
- `range(len(numbers) - 1)` prevents accessing an invalid next index.
- Return `False` as soon as the order is broken.
- Return `True` if all adjacent pairs are valid.
- Ascending order breaks when `numbers[i] > numbers[i + 1]`.
- Descending order breaks when `numbers[i] < numbers[i + 1]`.
- Best-case time complexity can be O(1).
- Worst-case time complexity is O(n).
- Extra space complexity is O(1).
- Sequential loops are added.
- Nested loops are multiplied.

## Day 9 — Find the Second Largest Distinct Element

### 1. Problem

Given an array/list, find the **second-largest distinct element**.

Example:

`[10, 5, 20, 8, 15]`

Result:

`15`

The word **distinct** is important.

Example:

`[10, 20, 20, 5]`

The largest value is `20`.

The second-largest **distinct** value is:

`10`

Not `20`.

---

### 2. Core Idea

Instead of sorting the entire array, we can find the second-largest value using a **single traversal**.

We maintain two values:

`largest`

`second_largest`

While traversing the array, each number is compared with these two values.

---

### 3. When a New Largest is Found

If the current number is greater than `largest`:

`number > largest`

then the old largest value becomes the new second largest.

The update is:

`second_largest = largest`

`largest = number`

Example:

`largest = 10`

`second_largest = 5`

New number:

`20`

Since:

`20 > 10`

we update:

`second_largest = 10`

`largest = 20`

The old largest moves to second largest.

---

### 4. When a New Second Largest is Found

If the number is not greater than `largest`, but it is greater than `second_largest`, it can become the new second largest.

For example:

`largest = 20`

`second_largest = 10`

New number:

`15`

Since:

`15 > 20` → False

but:

`15 > 10` → True

we update:

`second_largest = 15`

The largest remains:

`20`

---

### 5. Handling Duplicate Largest Values

Because we want the second-largest **distinct** value, a duplicate of the largest value must not become the second largest.

Example:

`[10, 20, 20, 5]`

After finding `20`:

`largest = 20`

`second_largest = 10`

When the second `20` is encountered:

`20 > 10` → True

but:

`20 != 20` → False

Therefore, the duplicate `20` is ignored.

The result remains:

`second_largest = 10`

---

### 6. Handling `None`

We can initialize:

`largest = None`

`second_largest = None`

`None` means:

> We have not found a value yet.

When the first number is encountered, it becomes the largest.

Example:

`largest = None`

`number = 20`

Therefore:

`largest = 20`

When another distinct number is found, it can become the second largest.

Example:

`largest = 20`

`second_largest = None`

`number = 15`

Therefore:

`second_largest = 15`

Using `None` is safer than initializing with `0` because array values could be negative.

---

### 7. Complete Algorithm

1. Initialize `largest` as `None`.
2. Initialize `second_largest` as `None`.
3. Traverse every number in the array.
4. If there is no largest value yet or the current number is greater than `largest`:
   - Move `largest` to `second_largest`.
   - Make the current number the new `largest`.
5. Otherwise, if the current number is different from `largest` and can become a larger `second_largest`, update `second_largest`.
6. Return `second_largest`.

---

### 8. Implementation

`def find_second_largest(numbers):
    largest = None
    second_largest = None

    for number in numbers:
        if largest is None or number > largest:
            second_largest = largest
            largest = number
        elif number != largest and (second_largest is None or number > second_largest):
            second_largest = number

    return second_largest`

---

### 9. Example

Input:

`[5, 10, 8, 15, 20]`

Trace:

`5`

`largest = 5`

`second_largest = None`

Then `10`:

`largest = 10`

`second_largest = 5`

Then `8`:

`largest = 10`

`second_largest = 8`

Then `15`:

`largest = 15`

`second_largest = 10`

Then `20`:

`largest = 20`

`second_largest = 15`

Final result:

`15`

---

### 10. Complexity Analysis

#### Time Complexity

The array is traversed once:

`for number in numbers`

For `n` elements, the loop can run `n` times.

Therefore:

**Time Complexity = O(n)**

This is a single-pass solution.

---

### 11. Space Complexity

The algorithm only uses a constant number of variables:

- `largest`
- `second_largest`
- `number`

It does not create another array or data structure.

Therefore:

**Extra Space Complexity = O(1)**

---

### 12. Why Not Sort the Array?

A simple alternative would be to sort the array first and then find the second-largest value.

However, sorting processes the entire array to arrange its elements.

Our approach only needs to keep track of:

`largest`

and:

`second_largest`

while scanning the array.

Therefore, our solution achieves:

`O(n)` time

and:

`O(1)` extra space

without sorting the array.

---

### 13. Edge Cases

#### Empty Array

`[]`

There is no largest or second-largest value.

Result:

`None`

#### One Element

`[5]`

There is no second-largest distinct value.

Result:

`None`

#### All Values Equal

`[20, 20, 20]`

There is no second-largest distinct value.

Result:

`None`

#### Duplicate Largest

`[10, 20, 20, 5]`

Result:

`10`

#### Negative Values

`[-10, -5, -20, -3]`

Largest:

`-3`

Second largest:

`-5`

Using `None` for initialization allows the algorithm to work correctly with negative values.

---

### 14. Important Python Concepts

#### `is None`

`largest is None`

checks whether `largest` has not been assigned a value yet.

#### `!=`

`number != largest`

means the current number is different from the largest value.

This is necessary because we are looking for the second-largest **distinct** value.

#### `and`

`number > second_largest and number != largest`

means both conditions must be true.

---

### 15. Key Takeaways

- The goal is to find the second-largest **distinct** value.
- Maintain two variables: `largest` and `second_largest`.
- A single traversal is enough.
- When a new largest is found, the old largest becomes second largest.
- A number can become second largest only if it is different from the largest.
- `None` is useful for representing "no value found yet."
- Empty and single-element arrays have no second-largest value.
- All-equal arrays have no second-largest distinct value.
- Time Complexity = O(n).
- Extra Space Complexity = O(1).
- This approach avoids sorting the entire array.

## Day 10 — Move All Zeros to the End

### Problem

Move all zeros in an array/list to the end while preserving the relative order of all non-zero elements.

Example:

`[0, 1, 0, 3, 12]` → `[1, 3, 12, 0, 0]`

`[0, 5, 0, 2, 8]` → `[5, 2, 8, 0, 0]`

### Goal

- Move every `0` to the end.
- Preserve the order of non-zero elements.
- Modify the original list in-place.
- Use O(1) extra space.

### Two-Pointer Approach

Use two variables:

- `i` → scanner that visits every element.
- `insert_pos` → position where the next non-zero element should be placed.

Initialize:

`insert_pos = 0`

Then scan the list using `i`.

If `numbers[i]` is zero:

- Do nothing.
- `insert_pos` remains unchanged.

If `numbers[i]` is non-zero:

- Swap `numbers[i]` with `numbers[insert_pos]`.
- Increment `insert_pos`.

### Code

`def move_zeros(numbers):`
`    insert_pos = 0`
``
`    for i in range(len(numbers)):`
`        if numbers[i] != 0:`
`            numbers[insert_pos], numbers[i] = numbers[i], numbers[insert_pos]`
`            insert_pos += 1`
``
`    return numbers`

### Example Trace

For:

`[0, 1, 0, 3, 12]`

Initially:

`insert_pos = 0`

When `i = 0`:

`numbers[0] = 0`

Zero is ignored.

List:

`[0, 1, 0, 3, 12]`

When `i = 1`:

`numbers[1] = 1`

Swap positions `insert_pos` and `i`:

`[1, 0, 0, 3, 12]`

Then:

`insert_pos = 1`

When `i = 2`:

`numbers[2] = 0`

Zero is ignored.

When `i = 3`:

`numbers[3] = 3`

Swap:

`[1, 3, 0, 0, 12]`

Then:

`insert_pos = 2`

When `i = 4`:

`numbers[4] = 12`

Swap:

`[1, 3, 12, 0, 0]`

Final result:

`[1, 3, 12, 0, 0]`

### Mental Model

Think of the two pointers as:

`i` → searches for non-zero elements.

`insert_pos` → tells where the next non-zero element belongs.

Therefore:

**i searches → insert_pos places**

### Why Swapping Is Used

We use:

`numbers[insert_pos], numbers[i] = numbers[i], numbers[insert_pos]`

instead of only:

`numbers[insert_pos] = numbers[i]`

because simple assignment can overwrite an existing value and lose it.

Swapping moves the non-zero element forward while moving the zero toward the end.

### Why Relative Order Is Preserved

Non-zero elements are processed from left to right.

Therefore, they are placed in the same order in which they originally appeared.

Example:

`[0, 5, 0, 2, 8]`

Non-zero elements appear as:

`5 → 2 → 8`

Final result:

`[5, 2, 8, 0, 0]`

The order remains unchanged.

### In-Place Modification

The algorithm modifies the original list instead of creating a new list.

Example:

`numbers = [0, 1, 0, 3, 12]`

After calling:

`move_zeros(numbers)`

the original `numbers` becomes:

`[1, 3, 12, 0, 0]`

### Complexity Analysis

Time Complexity:

`O(n)`

The list is scanned once.

Space Complexity:

`O(1)`

Only the variables `i` and `insert_pos` are used.

The algorithm works in-place.

### Key Takeaways

- Two pointers can solve array rearrangement problems efficiently.
- `i` scans the array.
- `insert_pos` tracks the next position for a non-zero element.
- Zeros are skipped.
- Non-zero elements are swapped into position.
- Relative order of non-zero elements is preserved.
- The algorithm runs in O(n) time.
- The algorithm uses O(1) extra space.
- The original list is modified in-place.
